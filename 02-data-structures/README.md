# Data Structures
* Lecture Exercise: <https://github.com/Joshua-Miles/data-structures-lecture-exercises>

### Learning Goals

- Explain the differences between Arrays and Hashs 
- Use `each` to find a specific element in an array
- Use `find` and  `select` to find specific things in an array
- Use `map` to turn an array of one thing into an array of another thing


### Vocabulary
* Array
    * Unenumerated list of elements (we don't know how many there are)
* Hash
    * An enumerated list of elements (we know how many there are, and we give them names)
* each
    * let's us run code for each thing inside of an array
* find
    * returns a **single thing** inside an array that matches a condition
* select
    * returns an array of things that match a condition
* map
    * Exchanging each element in an array (turns an array of one thing into an array of another thing)

- *Think-Pair-Share:* 

1. Categorize each of the following things as being better modled by an array or a hash, or a specific combination.
2. When you're finished, get with a partner and compare your conclusions. Discuss any differences between your answers and how you arrived at the conclusions you did.
