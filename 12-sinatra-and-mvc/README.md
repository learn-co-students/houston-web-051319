# Sinatra and MVC

### Structural Challenges in Mod 1
* Similar methods in two different classes
* Methods that are super long
* Error handling -> poor code seperation
* Difficult to plan (no clear place to put any given code)

### Defining MVC
* Model - Represents a single source of truth for our data
* Controller 
    * Joins the Model and the View 
    * Handles the communication between the Model and the View
* View
    * What the user sees
