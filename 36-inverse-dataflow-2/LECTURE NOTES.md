# Components and Props

### Learning Goals

* Identify the Visual Components of a UI
* Explain the difference between defining and rendering a component
* Use props to configure a child component
* Use the spread operator to pass props to a child component

### Activation

* As we came to the end of Mod 3, we used Object to represent distinct visual components of our UI
* What is the difference between defining and instantiating (draw a table)
* How did we configure class instances? (keep drawing)



|                                 | Class                                  | Function          | Component |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Sets up a template to use later | Defining                               | Defining          |           |
| Actually using that template    | Instantiating                          | Invoking          |           |
| Configuring each instance       | Passing arguments into the constructor | Passing arguments |           |



### Learning Goal 1: Identify the Visual Components of a UI

##### Demonstrate

* Breaking down a site into a visual hierarchy
  * Do parts of our UI repeat?
  * Do parts of our UI share common data?

##### Questions

##### Guide 

* Breaking down a mock of React Dragons

##### Check for Understanding

* Think-Pair-Share: 
  * Go to youtube.com
  * List out all of the components you can identify in a hierarchy

##### Cue

* If we can break our UI into these individual elements, we can use React Components to represent each of the elements we identify



### Learning Goal 2: Explain the difference between defining and rendering a component

##### Demonstrate

* Defining a component  (DragonList , text-align: center)
* Rendering a component
* This is similar to the difference between defining and instantiating an object!
* What `render` does
  * Rules of JSX
    * We interpolate variables with `{}`
    * Using map to iterate
    * Using ternarys to conditionally render

##### Questions

##### Guide 

- Defining a component to represent the first Dragon in our mock

##### Check for Understanding

* Kahoot [1-3]

##### Cue

* Now we've looked at the difference between defining and rendering a component, but it really isn't all that valuable to us if our components will be static. We need a way to configue them





### Learning Goal 3: Use props to configure a child component

##### Demonstrate

* That props is a **property** of our components
* That props is an **object**
* Using props to configure our DragonCard component
* Passing props from DragonList to each of our DragonCards
* This is the same as passing variables into the constructor when instantiating an object

##### Questions

##### Guide 

* Driver/Navigator: How could I do this if I were iterating over an array?

##### Check for Understanding

* Kahoot [4-6]

##### Cue

* Now we've seen how we can use props to configure a child component, but we definitely have some not dry code going on in our child component now



### Learning Goal 4: Use the spread operator to pass props to a child component 

##### Demonstrate

* Passing a whole object as props keeps us from being dry on both sides
* The spread operator can be useful;
  * The three dots are both the spread and the rest operator
  * They do related things

##### Questions

##### Guide 

* Driver/Navigator: How would I refactor this other component using the rest operator?

##### Check for Understanding

* Kahoot [7-9]

##### Cue

* Now we've used the spread operator to tighten up our code a little bit, but you might be wondering, what is the point? We can't change the data...



### Conclusion 

* Do you remember what we decided we were going to call of the **variable** data in our application?
  We were going to call it **state**. State is a literal concept in React, and we will learn how to leverage it so that our data can change in response to user interactions
