# Intro to Event Listeners

### addEventListener
* Takes two arguments
    * The type of event
    * A function to run when that event fires

### Event Types
* Bubbling Events (default)
    * Move from the inside out
* Capturing Events (pass true as the third argument of addEventListener)
    * Move from the outside in

### preventDefault
* Prevents the default browser defined behavior of any event

### DOMContentLoaded
* An event that fires after the DOM has been parsed
* Can be used to run DOM dependant JavaScript

## Deliverables
