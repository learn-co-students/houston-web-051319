# Intro to Node

### Learning Goals

- Describe the components of the MEAN / MERN stack:
- Create Models in JavaScript with sequelize
- Create Controllers in JavaScript with express
- Discuss the differences in the values of Ruby and JavaScript

### MEAN
* MongoDB - SQLite3 / postgres (Non Relational Database)
    * Object Relational Mapper (ActiveRecord -> Sequelize)
* Express - Sinatra / Rails Controllers (responding to HTTP requests)
* Angular / React 
* Node.js - Ruby

### Ruby / JavaScript
* More like pseudo code
* JavaScript is asynchronous
* JavaScript (sequelize) prefers automation (at least in regards to migration)
* JavaScript prioritizes abstraction over ruby
* Ruby prioritizes implicit code / JavaScript prefers explicit
