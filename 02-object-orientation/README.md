# Object Orientation
* Lecture Exercise: <https://github.com/Joshua-Miles/object-orientation-lecture-exercises>

##### Deliverables

- Refactor the logic for our hero "Spiderman" so that we can apply it to a new hero, "Thor"
- Implement a "coolest_ability" method, which finds the coolest ability in a heros coolest abilities array.
- Implement a method we can call to get the hero with the most abilities

### Learning Goals

- Explain the difference between objects and classes and their roles in making code more reuseable
- Use the `initialize` method to define variables inside of a class
- Use getter and setter methods to create object properties
- Use the `self` keyword to access methods within an object
- Explain the  difference between class and instance variables and properties 


Object
* Data + Behavior
* Specific examples of an idea

Class
* Makes objects / defines the data structure
    * We instantiate classes to create objects
* Represent ideas
