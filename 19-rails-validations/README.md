## Validation vs Authentication vs Authorization
* Validation
    * is the data good?
        * Is that string greater than 5 characters?
        * Is that number greater than 0?
* Authentication
    * Are you who you say you are?
        * Username
        * Password
* Authorization
    * Do you have the right to do what you asked?
